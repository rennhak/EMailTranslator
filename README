EMail Translator
-----------------

This simple tool takes different translation services from the web and allows MUA's such as mutt to
translate E-Mails on the fly. Admittedly this would be possible in a oneliner but that is not really
maintainable when it gets more complex.

Dependencies:

  o ruby
  o to_lang gem       https://github.com/jimmycuadra/to_lang

  o Google Translate API key
      Limit per day of 100,000 characters (as of 14/01/2011)
      Using 60 characters per line, 30 lines per page, 1800 characters per page
      That equals roughly 55 pages.


WARNING:

In the current version URLs and EMail addresses might be leaked to the translation service.
Data sanitization is a big todo for the next release. Currently, urls and most email addresses are
removed but this is not ensured. Use at own risk.
