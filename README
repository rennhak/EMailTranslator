EMail Translator
-----------------

This simple tool takes different translation services from the web and allows MUA's such as mutt to
translate E-Mails on the fly. Admittedly this would be possible in a oneliner but that is not really
maintainable when it gets more complex.

Dependencies:

  o ruby
  o to_lang gem       https://github.com/jimmycuadra/to_lang

  o Google Translate API key
